# Driver Drowsiness Detection System-project ðŸ˜´ ðŸš« ðŸš—
# Description
This project looks at how to detect tiredness in a driver in real time by looking at eye closure and yawning. This technology has the advantage of detecting tiredness early on and sounding an alarm before an accident occurs. The use of OpenCV is considered to be more suitable for this application based on the design of the proposed work because it meets the relevant requirements such as cost, power, and size. Face, eye, and mouth are easily detected by this technology, and these are captured using a webcam. The technology can detect whether the eyes and mouth were open or closed during monitoring. A warning signal will be issued if the eyes have been closed for an extended period of time or if yawning is detected.
# Applications ðŸŽ¯
This can be used by Drivers  who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents

# Code Requirements ðŸ¦„
The example code is in Python (version 2.7 or higher will work).

# Python Libraries
1.import cv2 <br>
2.import imutils <br>
3.import dlib <br>
4.import scipy <br>
5.import numpy <br>
6.import pygame <br>

# Description
A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.
# project Modules
The Model work is mostly divided into three steps:
1. Face, eye and mouth detection<br>
